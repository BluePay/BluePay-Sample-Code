# BluePay-Sample-Code

This sample code is meant for developers looking for a starting point to integrate their applications or website to the BluePay gateway.
This code is to be used as-is.

Please carefully read the comments in the sample code files for more information on how to connect your sandbox or live gateway account. Before you can start processing transactions, you must enter in your BluePay gateway Account ID and Secret Key. 
This [helpful video](https://www.bluepay.com/video/locating-your-bluepay-secret-key-and-account-id/?width=640&height=380) shows you how and where to grab these two values.
Also, depending on the platform and language you choose to write in, you may need to install additional libraries in order to successfully implement this sample code.

Since this sample code only works with the BluePay gateway, you will need a gateway account to utilize the code. [Click here](https://www.bluepay.com/contact-us/request-sandbox-account/) if you'd like to request a sandbox account
